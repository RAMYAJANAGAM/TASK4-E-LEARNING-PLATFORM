Task-4 is to design and develop the front-end of an interactive e-learning platform that includes core features such as course listing, progress tracking, and video embedding. This platform is designed to help students and learners access various courses online in an organized and user-friendly interface. The user interface is designed with simplicity and usability in mind so that learners of all ages and technical levels can navigate and use it comfortably. The platform features multiple pages such as a homepage, courses page, individual course detail page, and a dashboard for tracking progress. Each course card displays a thumbnail image, title, description, and a button to start or continue learning.

One of the key features implemented is video embedding, which allows students to watch course videos directly within the platform using <iframe> elements integrated with YouTube or other video hosting services. The progress tracking functionality is implemented visually using progress bars, allowing learners to see how much of the course they've completed. A dashboard is designed to show enrolled courses, percentage completed, and upcoming lessons, which helps in self-paced learning.

To build this project, we used standard frontend web technologies. The main tools and libraries used include HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript for the core structure and interactivity. For additional design enhancements and responsiveness, Bootstrap (a CSS framework) was used to create mobile-friendly and visually appealing layouts. JavaScript was used to dynamically render course data and update user progress. The project is modular, using reusable components such as course cards and navigation bars to maintain clean and efficient code.

The development environment was set up using Visual Studio Code (VS Code), a powerful and beginner-friendly source code editor. VS Code extensions like Live Server, Prettier, and HTML/CSS support tools made development smooth and efficient. For managing the project files and structure, basic folder organization was used, including separate directories for HTML files, CSS stylesheets, JavaScript scripts, and media assets such as images and icons.

This e-learning front-end platform is applicable in multiple real-world scenarios. It can be used by schools, colleges, online academies, training centers, and even individual tutors who want to offer learning content digitally. It's also ideal for corporate training programs, internship portals, and MOOCs (Massive Open Online Courses). With small backend integration, it can be extended into a full-fledged LMS (Learning Management System).
